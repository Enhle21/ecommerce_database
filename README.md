 E-commerce Database Project

HI ,THERE!

This project is a group assignment where we created a database for an online store.
It includes a picture of the database (called an ERD), all the SQL code to create the tables, 
and the code to link the tables together with foreign keys.

 Whatâ€™s Inside

 File Name         -    What It Does                                  
---------------------------------------------------------------
-`ecommerceDB.sql`  -  Creates all the tables for the online store   
 -`foreign_keys.sql` -  Adds the links (foreign keys) between tables  
-`ecommerce_erd.drawio` -  A picture that shows how the tables are linked

DATABASE NAME: e'commerce database

How to Use It


1. Open MySQL or any database tool.
2. Run the ecommerceDB.sql file to create all the tables.
4. Then run the foreign_keys.sql file to link everything together.
5. Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™re done ðŸŽ‰

What This Database Can Do


- Store products and details like brand, price, and category.
- Add images for each product.
- Support different sizes and colors for the same product.
- Save extra product info like material or weight.
- Easily manage categories, brands, attributes, and more.

ERD (Diagram)


- You can look at the ecommerce_erd.drawio file to see a full picture of the database.
- It shows:
- All the tables
- How they are connected
- What kind of relationships they have (like one-to-many)

  Group Work

  
We worked together to plan, design, and build the database.
We used tools like GitHub to share our work and help each other stay on track.

Tools We Used


MySQL â€“ for creating the database
Draw.io â€“ for the ERD diagram
GitHub â€“ to share files and work as a team
